[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/marco-m/clim.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/marco-m/clim)

Command-line argument parsing for Go:

* Simple, small, can parse anything via the Value interface.
* No calls to os.Exit: easy to test, total control over termination.
* No output behind your back, always returns a string: easy to test.
* Support for subcommands.
* Support for help.
* Support for subcommand groups.

## How does it look like?

```console
$ go run ./examples/hg -h
hg -- Mercurial Distributed SCM

Usage: hg <command> [options]

available commands:

Repository creation:

 clone        make a copy of an existing repository
 init         create a new repository in the given directory

Remote repository management:

 incoming     show new changesets found in source
 outgoing     show changesets not found in the destination

Options:

 -h, --help    Print this help and exit
```

Let's follow a subcommand:

```console
$ go run ./examples/hg incoming -h
hg incoming -- show new changesets found in source

Usage: hg incoming [options]

Options:

 --bundle FILE             file to store the bundles into
 -f, --force               run even if remote repository is unrelated (default: false)
 -n, --newest-first        show newest record first (default: false)
 -r, --rev REV[,REV,..]    remote changeset(s) intended to be added

 -h, --help                Print this help and exit
```

It also supports optional multi-line description, multi-line examples and multi-line footer:

```console
$ go run ./examples/bang -h
bang -- bangs head against wall

 Long description.
 Could be multi-line.

Usage: bang [options]

Examples:

 One or more examples.

 Could be multi-line.

Options:

 -c, --count N              How many times (default: 3)
 --dry-run                  Enable dry-run (default: false)
 -s, --sequence N[,N,..]    bang sequence (default: 1,2,3)
 --wall WALL                Type of wall (default: cardboard)

 -h, --help                 Print this help and exit

## Examples

See directory [examples](examples/).

## Testing

There are two ways to test a program using clim. Pick the one you prefer:

1. Directly with Go tests.
2. With [rogpeppe/go-internal/testscript](https://github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal). If you are not familiar with testscript, try it. It is both powerful and simple. For a gentle introduction, see the blog series:
   [Test scripts in Go](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/test-scripts).

In particular, see [examples/bang](examples/bang), where the two approaches are shown.

## Status
